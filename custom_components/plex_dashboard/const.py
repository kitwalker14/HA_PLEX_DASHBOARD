# Entity_ids of the optional `plex_recently_added` HACS integration's
# per-type sensors. v0.6.x of that integration ships separate sensors per
# media type (movies, shows, music) rather than one unified sensor; each
# sensor's `data` attribute is what `upcoming-media-card` consumes
# directly. We surface three independent config fields so the user can
# pick (or auto-detect) the right entity for each card.
#
# Naming convention from plex_recently_added v0.6.x:
#   sensor.<name>_recently_added_movie   -> Movies
#   sensor.<name>_recently_added_show    -> TV episodes
#   sensor.<name>_recently_added_artist  -> Music
# where <name> is the integration's `name:` option (default `plex`),
# which gets doubled for Plex servers whose own slug starts with `plex`.
